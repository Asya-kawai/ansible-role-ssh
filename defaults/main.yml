# CAUTION!
# When you change ssh_port and enable firewall,
# ansible may disconnect to the server.
# As a result, you can not connect to the server on ssh_port,
# until restart the server.
#
# In particular, RHEL does not fully function firewall tasks...
# Even after reboot, you will not be able to login(it's a bug).
#
# If you want to enable firewall,
# select an alternate role for firewall
# ex) [ansible-role-firewall](https://github.com/Asya-kawai/ansible-role-firewall)
